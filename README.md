# miniRT

My version of the miniRT project at 42 school to implement a simple ray tracing program in c language that is able to render simple objects (Sphere, Plane, Square, Cylinder, Triangle)

This project has been successfully done with all mandatory tasks + 3 bonuses (Specualar light using phong method + 2 compound elements : Pyramid & Cube)

Feel free to use it to undestand the project, never use it for cheating!

Final mark :
